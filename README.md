The Chronos Project
===================

What is it?
-----------
The Chronos Project is an academic research project. It's aim is to provide simple versioned storage, for everyone. Chronos consists of several components, which will be released as soon as the corresponding research work is published.

Who is working on it?
---------------------
The project is currently a one-man show, as it is a major part of my on-going PhD thesis.

What about licencing?

All Chronos components are licensed under the aGPLv3 license, unless noted otherwise. All source code is provided in this GitHub repository.
