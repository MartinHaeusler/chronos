About ChronoSphere
==================

ChronoSphere is a [Model Repository](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juri_Rocco/publication/275637197_Collaborative_Repositories_in_Model-Driven_Engineering_Software_Technology/links/5540a98c0cf2320416ed0fd2.pdf) for models in the [Ecore](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Ecore) format defined in the [Eclipse Modeling Framework](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) (EMF). The core features include:

* Efficient storage of Ecore models with up to several 100.000 elements.
* Model versioning with commit-granularity.
* Model indexing and model-level query support.
* Developer-friendly API, dependency management via Maven / Gradle.
* Full support for dynamic Ecore (no source code generation required).
* Based on [ChronoGraph](https://github.com/MartinHaeusler/chronos/tree/master/org.chronos.chronograph), a versioned graph database.


<< Maven Coordinates will be shown here soon. >>
